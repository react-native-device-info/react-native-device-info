# CHANGELOG

## 8.0.6
- fix(ios, deviceType): support iOS-compiled app running on macOS (#1181, thanks @user-none!)
- fix(ios, isEmulator): correct emulator detection for arm64 simulator (#1180, thanks @Arkkeeper!)

## 8.0.5

- fix: remove husky from postinstall entirely

Apparently there is no way to conditionally run postinstall, and while
we really want husky for contributors here, we must not fail on install
of library consumers (and we don't want to install husky for everyone,
even though it's a great package)

## 8.0.4

- fix: prefix husky install with with npm or package install fails

Husky is just a pre-commit hook package we use for QA, quite unfortunate that as
we ported to the next major version in v8.0.3 I broke the install for everyone. Apologies! @mikehardy

## 8.0.3

- fix(types, PowerState): use Partial<PowerState> vs union with '{}' (#1175, thanks @vvscode!)

## 8.0.2

- fix(hasNotch): fix missing Pixel 4a model name in devicesWithNotch.ts (@zarvedan)

## 8.0.1

- BREAKING: Fix the exporting and importing of typings in ES6 build module (#1164, thanks @diego-antonelli!)

Note, if you use typescript, this requires a minimum version of typescript 3.8
This change was inadvertently released without realizing it was a breaking change, apologies.
It is close enough to the 8.0.0 release that it will stand here though, without bumping to 9.0.0

## 8.0.0

- BREAKING(ios, xcode): Xcode 12 required with #1137. Use 7.3.2 if you must use outdated Xcode (#1151)
- feat(android, hms/gms): add ability to run without play services (#1156, thanks @saghul!)

7.4.0 was inadvertently breaking. I hadn't realized any iOS developers failed to update Xcode to stable
after an Xcode release. For a variety of reasons, you should always keep Xcode up to date, nevertheless
dropping Xcode 11 support is breaking. Update your Xcode or use 7.3.2.

## 7.4.0

- feat(android, install referrer): add ability to run without install referrer (#1153, thanks @saghul!)
- BREAKING feat(ios, catalyst): added DeviceTypeDesktop to getDeviceType() (#1137, thanks @exotexot!)
- fix(android, install referrer): remove old install referrer api (#1150 @nicoburns!)
- chore(ci, example): add ios/android CI, lint CI, de-lint project (@mikehardy)

## 7.3.2

- fix: remove deprecated way of retrieving INSTALL_REFERRER on Android (#965) (@Minishlink)

### 7.3.1

- fix(android, test): drop mockito to 3.6.28 to fix android test build break (thanks @jamsch!)

### 7.3.0

- feat(android, build): add ability to specify firebase bill of materials for iid versioning (#1133, thanks @Dimon70007!)
- fix(notch): add Redmi 9 to hasNotch list (#1140, thanks @esgudnason!)
- test: Adding more tests and refactoring some getters (#1136, thanks @schie!)
- chore: dependency updates (@mikehardy)

### 7.2.1

- fix(test, mocks): extra comma syntax error in mock definition (#1134, thanks @DorianGrey!)

### 7.2.0

- feat(windows): implement additional methods (#1122, thanks @jaimecbernardo!)
- feat(windows): port C# Windows implementation to C++ (#1113, thanks @jaimecbernardo!)
- feat(test, mocks): adding rest of jest mocks (#1132, thanks @schie!)
- fix(ios, keychain): change keychain access control to non-deprecated value (#1131, thanks @dmitry-bluescape!)

### 7.1.0

- feat(hasHms): added `hasHms` to indicate if Android device supports Huawei Mobile Services. (#1129, thanks @craig95!)
- feat(hasGms): added `hasGms` to indicate if Android device supports Google Mobile Services. (#1129, thanks @craig95!)

This release includes a truly enormous amount of testing and internal refactoring work that has made the module much
easier to maintain, all courtesy of @schie in the form of a pile of PRs implementing the same. Thank you, Dustin Schie!

### 7.0.2

- fix(windows): remove use of Object.fromEntries (#1110, thanks @jaimecbernardo!)

### 7.0.1

- fix(hasNotch): fix missing Redmi 7 and Pixel 3a model name in devicesWithNotch.ts (#1107, thanks @tronin!)
- fix(hasNotch): fix missing Samsung A21s model in devicesWithNotch (#1106, thanks @djhr!)

### 7.0.0

- BREAKING CHANGE: Increase iOS minimum to iOS 10. Stay on 6.x if you need to support iOS 9
- fix(iOS): supporting `getFontScale` in App Extensions (#1097, thanks @schie!)
- feat(mocks): add default set of mocks (#1102, thanks @schie!)

The change to iOS10 minimum was required to fix getFontScale for App Extensions
react-native 0.63 already requires iOS 10 minimum, so this is in harmony with the ecosystem

### 6.2.0

- feat(hooks): add useIsHeadphonesConnected hook (#1084, thanks again @schie!)

### 6.1.0

- feat(hooks): add useManufacturer hook (#1083, thanks @schie!)
- fix(types): add returnType to getPowerState (#1082, thanks @ferdicus!)

### 6.0.4

- fix(android): fix swapped data/root values in getFreeDiskStorageSync (#1077, thanks @violetchow2611!)

### 6.0.3

- fix: Xcode 12 compatibility (thanks @radko93! #1075)

### 6.0.2

- fix(windows): Targetplatform change for cpp apps to use this module (#1072, thanks @tero-paananen!)

### 6.0.1

- Added the 2nd generation iPhone SE to the deviceNamesByCode list (#1068, thanks @steve-lorenz!)

## 6.0.0

- BREAKING CHANGE(android, storage): Replace`getTotalDiskCapacity` and `getFreeDiskStorage` implementations, original
  implementations are `getTotalDiskCapacityOld` and `getFreeDiskStorageOld`. New implementation adds `Root` and `Data` file systems.
  Old implementations are deprecated, they use deprecated Android APIs, and they will disappear in a future version.
  This _should_ be a positive change as the resulting calculation should match Android settings storage calculation,
  but the old API is there if you need it, and you can open an issue to discuss if necessary. (#1054, thanks @gabriel-franzoni-pier!)

- BREAKING CHANGE(windows, vNext): The windows support has been ported from C# (react-native-windows <= 0.59) to C++
  (react-native-windows >= 0.59). This drops support for react-native-windows lower than 0.59. The port
  was developed and tested against react-native-windows 0.62.5. (1059#, thanks @tero-paananen!). The getTotalMemory APIs
  were dropped in the process (it appears react-native-windows vNext does not support them)

## 3.0.0-rc.3

- fix: TypeScript getPowerState() return type was Object instaed of PowerState interface
- fix: TypeScript definition file was missing getPhoneNumberSync()

## 3.0.0-rc.2

- Added a sync version of each API call, in practice it is very difficult to consume async
  APIs during app bootstrap and device info is frequently fundamental to app startup behavior.
  This still preserves the change away from paying the entire cost of information retrieval at
  startup - now you will only pay for exactly what you need.

## 3.0.0-rc.1

- fix incorrect use of macos for API selection vs ios in rc.3, rendering ios builds mostly useless

- BREAKING CHANGE: more capitalization changes for API calls to standardize (see below)
- BREAKING CHANGE: more return value changes to standardize return values (see below)
- feat: you no longer have to be careful with platform-specific APIs, all APIs will work, just
  returning standard "unknown" return values (see above breaking change, and example App.js usage)

## 3.0.0-beta.2

- fix all emulator/simulator v2->v3 discrepancies

## 3.0.0-beta.1

Each BREAKING CHANGE contains the required information to migrate. The example App.js shows sample usage.

- BREAKING CHANGE: Every API call returns a Promise now (and thus no more Android constructor with async boolean argument)
  - This was required to improve module load speed, handle dynamic values, and release the main queue for iOS
- BREAKING CHANGE: Every API call with acronyms ('getIP', 'getABI' etc follows pure camel-case now, e.g. 'getIp', 'getAbi')
  - This naming style is a consensus standard. Previously APIs here were half one way half the other. Now they are consistent
  - isAirPlaneMode -> isAirplaneMode
  - getIPAddress -> getIpAddress
  - getMACAddress -> getMACAddress
  - getAPILevel -> getApiLevel
  - getBaseOS -> getBaseOs
  - getInstanceID -> getInstanceId
  - getUniqueID -> getUniqueId
  - supportedABIs -> supportedAbis
- BREAKING CHANGE: all events prefixed with 'RNDeviceInfo\_' (https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-device-info/issues/620)
  - This is required as event names are a global namespace and collisions are inevitable otherwise
  - powerStateDidChange -> RNDeviceInfo_powerStateDidChange
  - batteryLevelDidChange -> RNDeviceInfo_batteryLevelDidChange
  - batteryLevelIsLow -> RNDeviceInfo_batteryLevelIsLow
- BREAKING CHANGE: Android `getBuildNumber` returns string like iOS (https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-device-info/pull/648)
- BREAKING CHANGE: remove is24Hour, getTimezone, isAutoTimeZone and isAutoDateAndTime, getDeviceLocale, getDeviceCountry, getPreferredLocales
  - This was the result of a survey. It removes API duplication in the react-native-community modules
  - Related PR: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-localize/pull/65
  - Use `yarn add https://github.com/mikehardy/react-native-localize.git#e062f0d2dc3171dc18fdb7b7139d347ad03933dc` to maintain isAutoTimeZone + isAutoDateAndTime until merged
- BREAKING CHANGE: iOS switch deprecated WebView for WebKit / getUserAgent returns Promise (https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-device-info/pull/757)
  - The change from WebView to WebKit was required as the API is being removed from the iOS platform
- BREAKING CHANGE: if an API is platform-specific, all non-implementing platforms will return standard values of -1, false, or 'unknown' depending on return type
  - This was how most APIs behaved before but it was not 100% - some returned null or empty string before
  - getPhoneNumber sometimes returned null, now it will be 'unknown' if not known
- deprecated: IP-address-related methods deprecated - use @react-native-community/netinfo or react-native-network-info or react-native-carrier-info
- feat: all APIs are now restricted in Javascirpt to the platforms they have full implementations on so the web polyfill is up to date
- feat: 'getAndroidId' on Android returns android.provider.Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID, read platform docs for usage
- feat: `getUsedMemory` (https://github.com/rebeccahughes/react-native-device-info/pull/356)
- feat: getDeviceName() without Bluetooth permission on Android (https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-device-info/issues/735)

### iOS notice

This is existing policy but is worth mentioning: The list with device names (returned by `getModel()`) is maintained by the community and could lag new devices. It is recommended to use `getDeviceId()` since it's more reliable and always up-to-date with new iOS devices. We do accept pull requests that add new iOS devices to the list with device names

## 0.7.0

adds two new parameters, Device Locale and User Agent.

## 0.5.0

adds a new parameter; Device Id. On iOS this is the hardware string for the current device (e.g. "iPhone7,2"). On Android we use the BOARD field which is the name of the underlying board, e.g. "goldfish". The way that the module gets the device model on iOS has also changed to be based on the Device Id; now instead of getting a generic product family e.g. "iPhone", it will return the specific model e.g. "iPhone 6".
